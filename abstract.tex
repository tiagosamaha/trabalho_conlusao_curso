\noindent The aim of this work is to present the concept of Executable Documentation as an evolution of traditional documentation, which brings advantages such as the possibility of user training and requirements validation. Additionally, this format of documentation tends to keep synchronized with the source code, while documenting, training takes place, adding more value to the user. Therefore, a case study was implemented on the EPCT Digital Library, having as a direct result the creation of an executable documentation module for that application, as well as the description of the use of Amberjack2 and jQuery libraries to implement executable documentation. \\


\noindent KEYWORDS: executable documentation, automated tests, training
